# VB_D2DControl

 Test draggable layered child control (Manifest) with Direct2D/DirectComposition in VB.NET
 
 To be fixed :  [UpdateLayeredWindow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-updatelayeredwindow) is used for dragging and transparency with animated sprites but it takes too much CPU resources
 when draggable sprites are too big or if there are too many draggable animated controls at same time. Another method should be used...
